    <h1>What's a Chat Group</h1>
    <p>
      A chat group is defined by the name that you give it upon creation. You can invite and add members
      to the group by entering their gmail addresses. Chat groups can be used to communicate with
      multiple people or just one. Make sure you separate the addresses with a comma ‘,’ if you’re inviting multiple people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon invitation, the group members will receive an email asking them to join your chat. Once they navigate to your chat group,
      all of the members will be able to send and receive messages along with the Google Home user.
    </p>
    <p>
      After submitting your new chat group, you will be redirected to your group chat where you can see all messages that were previously
      sent as well as any new messages. Now you can send your own messages! Try typing a message in the text box and hitting send. All of
      the group members will now see your message. If you'd like change group chats or invite more people, click the "back" button in the
      upper left corner. ChenChat can also be used on any mobile device. Your friends can navigate to the url and send/receive messages
      from their phones.

    <h1>Instructions for Using ChenChat with Google Home:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Say either "hey Google" or "ok Google" to Google Home</li>
      <li>Immediately after, say "Talk to C Chat." This will start ChenChat on your Google Home</li>
      <li>Once you start ChenChat from the Google Home, the device will listen for your next command until you tell it to end the application.
        Examples for commands to end the app are provided below.</li>
      <li>Once the application is started, you can give the application a variety of commands.</li>
      <li>Close the application by saying "leave chat," "I'm done chatting", or "close app."</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>List of Commands</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Send for help</li>
        <ul>
          <li>"Help me."</li>
          <li>"Call for help!"</li>
          <li>"Send help.”</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Say how you're feeling</li>
        <ul>
          <li>"I want to go to bed.”</li>
          <li>"I'm thirsty!"</li>
          <li>“Starving!"</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Express a personal need</li>
        <ul>
          <li>“I need to type.”</li>
          <li>“I need to use the phone.”</li>
          <li>“I want to use the mouse.”</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Ask for help finding objects</li>
        <ul>
          <li>“I need my straw.”</li>
          <li>“I can’t find my mouthpiece.”</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Create a chat group or navigate to an existing one</li>
      <ul>
        <li>“Enter chat group .”</li>
        <ul>
          <li>“Enter chat group ‘Food’.”</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Once you change the chat room using the Google home, the ChenChat server will
          automatically navigate all users to the same chatroom that was requested. Think of
          this as a convenience for users like Chun-Han. For example, when Chun-Han changes the
          chatroom to “fruits”, it will lead all users to the room “fruits”. In a way, all users are
          forced to follow Chun-Han’s needs. It ensures that there are users on the other end that are listening to Chun-Han’s requests.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Customize your own message</li>
      <ul>
        <li>“Send message .”</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: “Send message ‘Come downstairs’.”</li>
        </ul>
        <li>“Send to .”</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: “Send ‘What’s up’ to ‘Friends’.”</li>
        </ul>
        <li>“Say to .”</li>
      </ul>
      <li>End a conversation with the ChenChat app</li>
      <ul>
        <li>“Leave chat."</li>
        <li>"I'm done chatting."</li>
        <li>"Close app.”</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
